## Course Objectives and Topics

This course is the first in the Computer Science and Software Engineering programs at the Faculty of Computer Science and Data Science. Subsequent courses will develop and deepen the topics presented in this course.

### Learning Objectives

- Introduce fundamental concepts in computer science
- Begin acquiring tools for systematic thinking about problems
- Learn to understand problems and think about algorithms for their solutions
- Start thinking in terms of correctness and efficiency of algorithms for problem-solving
- Learn principles of procedural programming and object-oriented programming
- Concepts and principles are learned and practiced using the Java programming language

### Course Topics

1. Basic computer science terms and the concept of algorithms
2. Basic algorithms
3. Correctness and efficiency of algorithms. Using invariants
4. Arrays and functions
5. Basic search algorithms
6. Basic sorting algorithms
7. Definitions, principles, and recursive algorithms. The memoization principle
8. Basic data structures: array, linked list, binary trees, search trees
9. Abstract data types: queue, stack, set, list
10. Classes, inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces
11. Operations on data structures and problem-solving using them
12. Comparators
13. Iterators
14. Graphs and graph algorithms
15. Selected topics in computer science

## Course Requirements and Grading Components

### Grade Composition

The course includes:
- Final exam
- Midterm exam
- Homework assignments
- Weekly exercises
- Weekly preparation questionnaires for lectures

**Submission requirement:** All assignments must be submitted.

**Passing requirement:** Must pass the final exam.

### Grading Breakdown

**If the final exam grade is passing (>55):**

| Component | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Final exam | 70% |
| Midterm exam | 20% |
| Weekly exercises | 2% |
| Homework assignments | 5% or 6% (depending on number of assignments) |
| | 1% per assignment. There will be 5-6 homework assignments |
| Weekly questionnaires | 3% (entrance questionnaires for lectures) |
| | If there are 6 homework assignments, the weight of weekly questionnaires will be 2% |

**Otherwise:** The final exam grade will constitute 100% of the course grade.

### Notes on Grade Weighting

- If exempted from a specific assignment (exam/homework/exercise/questionnaire) - the weight of that assignment transfers to the final exam
- Homework assignments may be checked partially only. In such cases, the grade for the entire assignment will be determined based on the parts that were checked
- Grade changes for homework will only be made during the appeals window that will be set. It will not be possible to appeal a homework grade after the appeals period ends
- If the midterm exam does not take place for any reason, the weight of the final exam will be 90%

### Important Note about Midterm Exam

Research has proven that participation in a valid midterm exam statistically increases the grade on the final exam. This is due to the fact that the learning process involved in participating in the exam is significant and beneficial. Additionally, a low grade on the midterm exam indicates in most cases the need to strengthen mastery of course material and adjustment of study habits, and indeed, this usually encourages a positive change in study habits.

Therefore, if the final exam grade is (significantly) higher relative to the midterm exam grade, it should be understood that the situation reflected from the midterm results caused the necessary change.

This should be acknowledged. **Requests to cancel the midterm weight in the grade calculation will not be accepted.**

## Academic Integrity

Plagiarism in an academic course is considered a serious offense. Academic dishonesty includes any action of copying or enabling copying from any of the course assignments.

### Partnership Assignments

If an assignment is submitted in pairs: both partners are fully responsible for the assignment. Dishonesty by one partner automatically results in dishonesty of the second partner. If copying occurs, both sides involved (the side that copied and the side that enabled copying) are equally guilty.

### Consequences

In case of suspected academic dishonesty, a complaint will be filed with the university disciplinary committee according to academic regulations. A detailed report of the case will be included in the personal file. **Minimum penalty for plagiarism is a zero grade in the course.** In serious cases, expulsion from the university is also possible.

### Code Sharing Policy

**For the avoidance of doubt:** Code segments or answers belonging to assignment solutions **cannot be shared in any form or manner**, neither verbally nor in writing.
